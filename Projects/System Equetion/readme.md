# System equetion

This script gets an equetion like <i> Ax = b </i>.<br />
It gets matrix A and vector b, and then converts A to reduction echelon. Then it will give us the equetions <br />
from matrix, and states the free and non-free variables.<br />
It also checks the correctness of the system.<br />
